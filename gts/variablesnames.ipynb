    "### 1.3 Variables and Names \n",
    "Now we can print with *print* and can do math with *math*. The next step is to learn about variables. In programming, a variable is a piece of data that can change over time. In other words, a variable is nothing more than a name for something, similar to my name \"Kalyango\" is a name for the human who is teaching you this course. \n",

    "Programmers use these variable names to make their code more readable and understandable. In this exercise, you will learn how to declare variables and assign. You will also learn how to use variables to store data.  \n",
